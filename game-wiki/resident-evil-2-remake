Rsident Evil 2

Resident Evil 2[a] is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. A remake of the 1998 game of the same name, it was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a zombie outbreak.

Capcom considered remaking Resident Evil 2 following the successful release of the remake of the first Resident Evil in 2002, but was delayed as series creator Shinji Mikami did not want to divert development from the then-upcoming Resident Evil 4 (2005). Capcom announced the Resident Evil 2 remake in August 2015 and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at E3 2018.

Resident Evil 2 received critical acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous "game of the year" awards. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 6.5 million copies worldwide, outselling the original.
