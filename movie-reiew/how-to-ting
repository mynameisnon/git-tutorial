How To Ting (Happy Old Year) is the first film you should see in the new year

The title of a new Thai film is a bilingual wordplay: How To Ting is literally translated as "how to dump".
That, I think, is sharper than its tired official English title, Happy Old Year.
To dump or not to dump -- things and people, mementos and memories -- that is the question.
In the film, a young designer who's dressed like a Muji model, and who has just returned from studying in the minimalist-paradise Sweden, plans to dump all useless objects from her maximalist Bangkok house, where she lives with her mother and brother, and to turn it into an all-white, supremely sparse and unapologetically decluttered interior nirvana -- a home office lifted straight from a Scandinavian style book.
